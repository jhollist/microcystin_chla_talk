# Problem: What is a bloom?

## So of course, I asked Twitter

![](tweet1.jpg)

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of this variety

![](tweet2.jpg)

![](tweet3.jpg)

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of the more quantitative

![](tweet5.jpg)

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## And then the one closest to reality

![](tweet6.jpg)

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Take away message

- No real concensus
- Should be relative to some baseline
  - Clarity?
  - Public concern?
  - Health risk?
- Still left with a decision

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## What could we use?

- Toxins?
  - Most direct measure
  - Data few and far between
- Cell counts, bio-volume, etc.
  - Myriad problems
- Chlorophyll
  - Available
  - Associated with cyanobacteria?

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Assocation chlorohpyll a  concentration with Microcystin guidance levels

- Conditional probability 
    - Probability of one event happening, given another has already happened
    - Our approach based entirely on data
    - History in environemntal applications
- Data
    - 2007 NLA
    - EPA and WHO guidance levels
