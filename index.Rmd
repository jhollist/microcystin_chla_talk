# Problem: What is a bloom?

## So of course, I asked Twitter

![](tweet1.jpg)
---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of this variety

![](tweet2.jpg)

![](tweet3.jpg)

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of the more quantitative

![](tweet5.jpg)

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## and then the one closest to reality

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## Take away message

- No real concensus
- Should be relative to some baseline
  - Clarity?
  - Public concern?
  - Health risk?
- Still left with a decision

---

# Problem: What is a bloom?

## What could we use?

- Toxins?
  - Data few and far between
- Cell counts, bio-volume, etc.
  - Myriad problems
- Chlorophyll
  - Available, but is it associated with other cyano indicators

# Possible Solution: Chlorophyll as a proxy for Microcystin

---

# Possible Solution: Chlorphyll as a proxy

## Chlorophyll relationships with mcyst

- Scatter
- Lester
- Possible, but
- still don't know what to call "a bloom"

# Possible Solution: Chlorphyll as a proxy

## Exsiting Microcystin Advisory Levels 

- WHO
- EPA

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microcystin

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Conditional probability 

- What is it?
- What it tells us?

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Data

---

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Results

- cp plots

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Results

- tables

# Our Solution: Chlorophyll and Microsystin

## Validation with 2012

- How did it work finding exceedances?
