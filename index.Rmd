# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## So of course, I asked Twitter

# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of this variety

![](tweet2.jpg)

![](tweet3.jpg)

---

# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## Got some of the more quantitative

# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## Take away message

- No real concensus
- Should be relative to some baseline
  - Clarity?
  - Public concern?
  - Health risk?
- Still left with a decision

# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## What could we use?

- Toxins?
  - Data few and far between
- Cell counts, bio-volume, etc.
  - Myriad problems
- Chlorophyll
  - Available, but is it associated with other cyano indicators

# The Problem: What is a bloom?

## Chlorophyll relationships

- Scatter
- Lester
- Possible
